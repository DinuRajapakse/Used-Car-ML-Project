# Used-Car-ML-Project

## Introduction

Selling used cars can be difficult especially in today's market. Used cars are sold in a
variety of ways, such as franchise and independent car dealers, rental car companies, leasing
offices, auctions, and private parties. The goal of this project is to predict used car prices based
on various descriptions of the car to help individuals or dealerships sell used cars. We utilized
machine learning algorithms to predict the price at which you should buy or sell a car. We
obtained a dataset of used car prices from Kaggle containing 301 datapoints. Car name, year,
selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner are
the categories this dataset is split up into. A model can be created by splitting the training and
testing data 80/20

## Dataset Formation

Our dataset was found on kaggle which contains information on 301 used cars that is updated annually. The database contained features of the used cars including name of the car, year, selling price, present price, km driven, type of fuel, seller type, transmission, and number of past owners. The preprocessing for this dataset was generally simple as there was no missing data within the features of the dataset (see Figure \ref{fig:data}). \textbf{Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib was used to handle all data processing and visualization}.
